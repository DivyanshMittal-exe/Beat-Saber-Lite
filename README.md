# Beat Saber Lite


Beat Saber Lite is a simple yet fun and addictive game created with the help of [UnityGameEngine](https://unity.com/) in C#. Obviously as the name suggests, this draws its 
inspiration from the popular VR game [Beat Saber](https://beatsaber.com/).

The objective is simple, blocks in various orientations come hurtling towards in two streams and your objective is to destroy them before they move out of the screen, or else Game Over...

Destroying these blocks is also straightforward,Each block has an arrow on it. Destroy the blue blocks with <kbd>↑</kbd>
<kbd>↓</kbd>
<kbd>→</kbd>
<kbd>←</kbd> keys, by pressing the key corresponding to the arrow direction.  Destroy the red blocks with <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> keys, similar to the blue blocks. 

Press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to pause the game.

But a slight catch, the blue blocks come from the left, while the red ones from the right. This increase the chances of misclicks and missing the block.

Each block succesfull destroyed will give you a +10 while a misclick will attract a penalty of -5.

The speed of the blocks increases with time with the beat of the music, thus gradually increasing the difficulty.

Surely you will enjoy playing this game.

## Installation 

The game is currently available for windows and linux only.

Simply clone the git repo. Inside the `Game_Build_Windows` folder, you will find the exe file for the game. The `Game_Build_Windows` contains all the files you will need to run the game.
Apart from these, all the other files are the Game-Dev files and codes. You will need the Unity Game Engine to check them out.
